Thanks to Richard Lloyd (R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk) and the HP-UX Porting and
Archive Centre (http://hpux.csc.liv.ac.uk/) for compiling the HP-UX encryption
binaries.  The newer HP-UX binaries were downloaded from The Written Word's
free Open Source site (http://www.thewrittenword.com/free/downloads/).  All
archives have been repackaged as standard Info-ZIP distributions.

Thanks to Jens von Bulow (jens@nha.co.za) and Neil Harvey & Associates
(http://nha.co.za/) for porting and compiling the MPE/iX binaries, and to
Lars Appel (lappel@grc.hp.com) for pointing us at them.  Note that the two
*.gz archives come straight from ftp://ftp.nha.co.za/hp3000/unzip/ (i.e.,
they're completely unmodified by Info-ZIP).  Read unz531x-mpeix.README
before downloading them.  unz531x-mpeix.zip is a standard Info-ZIP package
containing the usual binaries and documentation.

All Info-ZIP packages contain documentation.  The sources are in ../../src .
